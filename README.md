<h2>Assignment Overview</h2>
<p>This assignment tests your skills in fetching data from an API and dynamically populating a web page with the loaded data in a user-friendly format. You may use Vanilla JS or JQuery as you wish.</p>

<h2>Assignment Steps</h2>

<h3>1. API Integration (20pts)</h3>
<p>a) Use JavaScript to fetch data from dummyjson.com about products from /products endpoint.<br>
        b) Handle any potential errors during the fetch operation.</p>

<h3>2. Data Display (1) (20 pts)</h3>
<p>a) Display the data on the home web page. Each product should include the title, price, discount, category, and stock as well as the thumbnail.<br>
        b) Ensure the display is well-formatted and readable.</p>

<h3>3. Data Display (2) (20 pts)</h3>
<p>a) When a product is clicked a new product info page is opened with the detailed information as well as the gallery of the product.</p>

<h3>4. Data Display (3)</h3>
<p>a) On the home page, provide the following features<br>
        I. Search for a keyword (it can be a part of title, desc, or even category) (15pts)<br>
        II. Filter based on the given category (all categories are to be provided as a select box and choosing any category from the list filters the list of all the products) (15 pts)<br>
        b) Use API documentation to explore available ones and their usage.</p>

<h3>5. Apply Pagination (Bonus) (10 pts)</h3>
<p>a) If the result of any response holds more than 10 objects, show only 10 products. Implement pagination navigation at the bottom of the list.</p>

<h2>Recording and Submission Details</h2>

<p>Please record a video using a screen recorder, including your face through the webcam and comments. Ensure each required feature is present in the video along with the corresponding code and detailed explanations of the implementation. Remove unnecessary parts from the video.</p>
