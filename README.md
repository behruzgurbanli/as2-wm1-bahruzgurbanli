This assignment tests your skills at fetching data from an API and dynamically populating a web page with the loaded data in a user-friendly format. You may use Vanilla JS or JQuery as you wish.

Here are the steps to complete the assignment:

API integration (20pts)
Use JavaScript to fetch data from dummyjson.com about products from / products endpoint.
Handle any potential errors during the fetch operation.
Data display (1) (20 pts)
Display the data on the home web page. Each product should include the title, price, discount, category, and stock as well as the thumbnail.
Ensure the display is well-formatted and readable.
Data display (2) (20 pts)
When a product is clicked a new product info page is opened with the detailed information as well as the gallery of the product.
Data display (3)
On the home page, provide the following features
Search for a keyword (it can be a part of title, desc, or even category) (15pts)
Filter based on the given category (all categories are to be provided a sa select box and choosing any category from the list filters the list of all the products) (15 pts)
Use API documentation to explore available ones and their usage.
Apply pagination (Bonus) (10 pts)
If the result of any response holds more than 10 objects, show only 10products. Implement pagination navigation at the bottom of the list.


You are required to record video using a screen recorder, where I expect to see your screen activities and your face (through the webcam) and hear your comments. In the recording, the following must be present

each required feature on the website
the code that supports the feature
detailed explanation of the way you implemented it


Please remove the unnecessary parts from the video (waiting for the installation and other idle times). You can prepare videos in a progressive way (every day a new part) and then merge them by editing. When done, upload it to Microsoft Stream under your ADA account ( https://web.microsoftstream.com ). Share the link in your submission.



Please work every day; this is not a task you can do on the last day!

To keep track of the progress, create a git repository, commit, and push each change to the repository.

Ensure that you have at least 1 commit a day otherwise, you will lose points.



Submission details: Here are the items to be submitted to the grader. A .zip file containing:

A report in Word format containing a detailed explanation of the code(ideally the purpose of each HTML component, JS function, and class should be properly explained).
A README file with clear instructions for setting up and running your application.
Include a link to the GitHub page that hosts the website.
Another document that contains a link to your video recording AND Git repository (e.g., on GitHub). Note: Make sure your video is accessible to other users before submitting it.
Source codes
No other compression format is accepted!



The main evaluation criteria will be:

Functionality: The webpage correctly fetches and displays data from the API.
Code Quality: The code is clean, well-organized, and easy to understand. (10 pts)
Error Handling: The application gracefully handles any network errors.
User Interface: The data is presented in a user-friendly and accessible manner.
Extra Challenges: Implementation of pagination and sorting features, if attempted.


It will give you 15% of the total.
